# DeSDA

This is the working repository of my PhD research on the automatic detection of syntactic difference (DeSDA). Whatever I publish will also be published here.

## CLIN28

In the CLIN28 folder you will find files for research presented at CLIN28 on the the development of a syntactic filter that automatically selects parallel sentences that are syntactically comparable.
